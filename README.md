[Clustering Customer Mall using K-Means](https://medium.com/@hasnanisrina/clustering-customer-mall-using-k-means-b56d2912da39)
--
In this article, I will discuss customer segmentation for a mall. The main goal is to understand the customers, particularly to identify which ones can be easily converted (target customers) so that valuable insights can be provided to the marketing team for better strategy planning. The method applied in this study is k-Means clustering.

[Price Optimization using GAM](https://github.com/hasnanisrina/price_optimization_gam)
--
Nowadays, determining the right price is crucial for a business. If the price is set too low, customers will hesitate to buy due to fear of poor quality. However, if it's too high, customers will also be reluctant to buy due to the high price. This is related to price elasticity. Price elasticity is a measure of how responsive the demand for a product is to changes in its price. The goal of this project is to determine the right price for a product using Generalized Additive Models (GAM).
