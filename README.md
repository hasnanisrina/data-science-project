[Clustering Customer Mall using K-Means](https://medium.com/@hasnanisrina/clustering-customer-mall-using-k-means-b56d2912da39)
--
In this article, I will discuss customer segmentation for a mall. The main goal is to understand the customers, particularly to identify which ones can be easily converted (target customers) so that valuable insights can be provided to the marketing team for better strategy planning. The method applied in this study is k-Means clustering.
